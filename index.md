# My Digital Billboard

## About Me 
Hi I'm Nick! I'm a software engineer at [RingIR](https://ring-ir.com/), where I currently function as a data analyst of spectroscopic data and a C++/Python developer for the software on portable gas detection devices. 

I'm a detail-focused individual that dedicates time to fully understanding the frameworks and systems I'm using before I write software. I value writing clean code that was made with the same level of love and care my mom used to make my school lunches with. My domain interests lie where computer science is applied to other scientific fields - more specifically: numerical computing, machine learning/AI, and serious game development.

Outside of my career, you'll find me rock climbing, playing 6-hour board games, or taking notes at a wine tasting. 

### Education
I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a Minor in Math from the University of New Mexico, as well as an Associate of Science from Riverside City College, California.
