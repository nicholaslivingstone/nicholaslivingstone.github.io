###### Undergrad Computer Science - University of New Mexico, Albuqueruque

Hi I'm Nick. I'm a Senior at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque. I have an Associate of Science from Riverside City College, California. 
I'm a detail focused individual that dedicates time to fully understanding the frameworks and and systems I'm using before I write code. 
My academic interests lie in numerical computing, machine learning, and game development.
Outside of school, I enjoy rock climbing, cycling, and the great outdoors. 

### Some of my work 
* *Title (Relevant Systems) - Description*
* [Analysis of Different types of Numerical Integration Methods (Fortran, Python, LaTex)](https://github.com/nicholaslivingstone/CS471-HW3) - A comparative analysis of Composite Trapezoidal and Guass Quadtrature numerical integration. 
* [Using Numerical Integration to Solve Systems of ODEs (MATLAB)]() - A report which discusses the effectiveness of Numerical Integration for solving systems of Ordinary Differential Equations
* [Wine Colors (R)]() - A Statistical summary of wine colors from UCIs ML Repository 
* [Book Serial Number Cleanser (Python)]() - Created for Parish Memorial Library as a method to cleanup serial numbers which were inconsistently formatted. Utilizes Pandas library and Regex.
