## Welcome to my digital billboard

Hi I'm Nick. I'm a Senior at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque studying computer science. I have an Associate of Science from Riverside City College, California. 
I'm a detail focused individual that dedicates time to fully understanding the frameworks and systems I'm using before I write code. My academic interests lie in numerical computing, machine learning, and game development.
Outside of school, I enjoy rock climbing, cycling, and board games.
